However, this Cardano Product Committee might create a similar problem to what we see in USA politics today where voters can only choose between a Republican elite sanctioned candidate or a Democrat elite sanctioned candidate.\n\nImagine if a select small clique get to influence the agenda of meetings and topics discussed in order to massage the items considered as options for the roadmap.  Eventually, DReps might feel pressured to vote for committee sanctioned roadmap options feeling they were freely selected by the community absent committee influence.  Voting this through will deliver special powers to Cardano Product Committee members allowing them to heavily influence what options are considered, debated, and ultimately voted on, for the roadmap.\n\nIt would be better to spend this money on developing a decentralised mechanism to gather and curate raw community sentiment."
